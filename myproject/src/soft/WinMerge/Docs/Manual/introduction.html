Introduction to WinMerge</a></h1>
<p>WinMerge is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" target=
"_top">Open Source</a> visual text file differencing and merging
tool for Win32 platforms. WinMerge can compare directories and
files and present differences in easy to understand and handle
format.</p>
<p>WinMerge is highly useful for determining what has changed
between project versions, and then merging changes between
versions. WinMerge can be used as external differencing/merging
tool or as standalone application.</p>
<p>In addition WinMerge has a lot of helping and supporting
features making comparing and synching/merging as easy and useful
as possible. Several programming languages and other fileformats
are syntax highlighted.</p>
<p>WinMerge is not an hex-editor. WinMerge can only inform user if
binary files are different or identical, but WinMerge does not
allow merging or editing binary files.</p>
<p>Goal of WinMerge development is to make comparing and
synch/merge of directories and files easy and fast. While
maintaining maximum reliability. Easiness reduces user errors.
Version 2.2 is remarkably better in this goal than version 2.0.</p>
<p>Please note that WinMerge is not freeware, but it is <a href=

licenced.</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN117" id="AEN117">3.1. WinMerge
versions</a></h2>
<p>There are three kind of versions available in <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216"
target="_top">downloads</a> page.</p>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3"><a name="AEN121" id="AEN121">3.1.1. Stable
versions</a></h3>
<p><a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;package_id=11248"
target="_top">Stable versions</a> are recommended for most users.
If you are unsure about what version to use - use latest stable
version.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3"><a name="AEN125" id="AEN125">3.1.2. Beta
versions</a></h3>
<p><a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;package_id=29158"
target="_top">Beta versions</a> are for people who want to test
latest features and improvements done after last stable version.
Beta versions are not so extensively tested as stable versions are
and probably have some bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3"><a name="AEN129" id="AEN129">3.1.3. Experimental
versions</a></h3>
<p><a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;package_id=92246"
target="_top">Experimental versions</a> are snapshot releases from
version control (CVS). They have all the latest features and
improvements. Some features may still be buggy and/or incomplete.
These releases are made available to allow users to try out the
current code without needing to compile, and participate in
development discussions concerning new and changing features. We
also appreciate any help testing the current code. Use with care
and enable backups! And please <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=113216"
target="_top">report bugs</a> you find using these builds, it
really helps with WinMerge development!</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN134" id="AEN134">3.2. Getting support
and reporting bugs</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=41637"
target="_top">Open discussion forum</a> is the fastest way to get
help. Please be patient, it may take some time anybody answers.</p>
<p>If you have found a bug, please submit it as a <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=113216"
target="_top">bug report</a>. Please attach as much information as
you can, at least the version number of WinMerge you are using. If
you can, attach also configuration log which you can see from menu
<span class="guimenu">Help</span>-&gt;<span class=
"guimenuitem">Configuration...</span> Good information in bug
report means better change for bug to be fixed faster.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN143" id="AEN143">3.3. WinMerge source
codes and development</a></h2>
<p>WinMerge source codes are available in <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216"
target="_top">downloads</a> page and from <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13216" target="_top">public
CVS server</a>. We welcome everybody to download the sources, study
them and alter them. If you find (and fix) bugs, improve something
etc, please submit your changes back to us as <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=313216"
target="_top">patches</a> and help improve this product!</p>
<p>While WinMerge development has been fast in last two years, all
this work is done by people in their spare time. Nobody gets paid
for improving WinMerge. We try to fix bugs as we find them or
somebody reports them to us. We really try - we use WinMerge too.
But there is absolutely no promises for new features. We always
appreciate any help with WinMerge, be it testing, documenting,
translating or coding.</p>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3"><a name="AEN150" id="AEN150">3.3.1. Participating
to WinMerge development</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we look for help in many areas, not just
coding. Translations, documentation and testing are important
too.</p>
<p><a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/developer/index.php"
target="_top">Developer pages</a> are good start if you want to
help with development.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=41639"
target="_top">Developers-forum</a> is best place to discuss about
development. If you are interested in helping with WinMerge
development, let us know. If you want to fix one of our <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=113216"
target="_top">bugs</a> or implement a <a href=
